### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler 


The project's objective is to display a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Income vs. Poverty` (code can be adjusted to have any other data variables representation in scatter plot).

Using D3 techniques, the code  in 'app.js' displays a scatter plot that represents each US state with circle elements. The data is pulled from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. 

* State abbreviations are included in the circles.

* Axes and labels are created to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: `python -m http.server` command is used to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
