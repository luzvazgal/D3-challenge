          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Obesity levels</h3>
          <p>According to <b>American Diabetes Associattion</b> (https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/), 
            "it has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. 
            Poverty-dense areas are oftentimes called “food deserts,” implying diminished access to fresh food. 
            However, 43% of households with incomes below the poverty line ($21,756) are food insecure (uncertain of having, 
            or unable to acquire, sufficient food). Accordingly, 14% of U.S. counties have more than 1 in 5 individuals use the 
            Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
          
          </p>

          <p>Also, there is evidence of the association between sedentariness, poor health, obesity, diabetes, other metabolic diseases, 
            and premature death (8). Sedentary individuals move 2 h per day less than active individuals and expend less energy, 
            and they are thereby prone to obesity, chronic metabolic disease, and cardiovascular death (9). 
            More than half of county-to-county variance in obesity can be accounted for by variance in sedentariness. 
            Overall, the poorest counties have the greatest sedentariness  and obesity..</p>

        <p>
          Several reasons may explain why people living in poor counties are less active. One reason may be that violence tracks with 
          poverty, thereby preventing people from being active out-of-doors. Similarly, parks and sports facilities are less available 
          to people living in poor counties (5, and people who live in poverty-dense regions may be less able to afford gym membership, 
          sports clothing, and/or exercise equipment".
